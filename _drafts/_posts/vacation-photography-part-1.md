Where are you going on vacation this year?  The shore, the mountains, visiting family, traveling outside the country or just taking some time off locally?  Wherever you find yourself take some time to get out and shoot.  Vacation help us to unwind and decompress.  A chance to recenter ourselves.  These moments help us to tap into our creative nature and for our creative nature to speed up recovery.

Some years I have traveled more extensively than others.  This year I am going to the shore in Rehoboth, Delaware for a week this summer.  Am excited to spend some time with my family and decompress.  Sit with my feet up and have beer.  It has been a hectic year and I am feeling a bit burned out.   When I am on vacation I try to take a few times to get away from the crew and do some photography.

It can seem a bit selfish to take time away from them when you are away with them.  This concept may leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Vacation is partially about recharging yourself, find the inner calm that can allud us going through our everyday lives.  By me taking these few hours while away with my family will make me a better husband and father for them.

Part of my apporach to minimize my time way from them and maxinies it benefit to me is a lot of planning, preproduction as it where.  Over this series I will break down how I go about planning, packing and strategies for shooting.  I know my 10 year would will hold me to it when I say I am going shooting for a few hours.  If I come back at the end of the day he will let me have it.

We all have different things we strive to capture with our photos.   I have a vision and I want to go after it like a dog with a bone.  A lot of the time it falls into the commercial photography world for me.  Plan to shoot some of the things you like and as always we would say put a close-up twist on it. 

 Get the kids involved, taking some different types of photos with them, stuff you have not done in the past  Toddlers hands in the surf as the explore the ocean.  Your love’s eyes with the sunlight dancing on the water in the background.  Your teens hands grabbing the rock as the climb in the mountains.   Your spouse as they smell a flower.  The possibilities with food is endless. 

Share your favorite place to vacation and some of the images you are taking.  Get out and enjoy some photography while you are enjoying time away with those who you are closest to.  Going away with new friends, you may just find a shared passion.
