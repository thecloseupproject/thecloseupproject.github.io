This will be a different type of article but one I hope some of you will find interesting or useful.  We recently relaunched our TheCloseUpProject.com after a couple of years of inactivity and I wanted to put together a post that talks about the technology and workflow we use to manage the site right now and keep it up-to-date as we move forward with this project.

In this post I’ll cover:

* Workflow and Organization
* Writing and Editing
* Site Architecture
* Marketing
* Plans for the Future

**Workflow and Organization**

We make use of [Trello](https://trello.com/) a lot here at the site.  If you’re unfamiliar with Trello, it is essentially a board where you can create lists and cards and drag them around as you make progress on a task.  We have boards for:

* Our post calendar
* Site development/maintenance tasks
* Our Email Newsletter
* Marketing Idea/projects

We like trello because its flexibility allows us to stay organized all in one place without having to use multiple tools.  It also lets you get a high level view of where a project or post stands without having to dive too deep.
