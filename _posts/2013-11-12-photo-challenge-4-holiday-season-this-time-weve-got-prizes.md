Congratulations again to the <a title="Announcing the Winners of Photo Challenge 3" href="http://thecloseupproject.com/announcing-the-winners-of-photo-challenge-3/">winners from our last photo challenge!</a>  We got such a great response from the open format of the last challenge that we've decided to keep an on-going free-for-all category.  During each challenge period we'll pick a winner in the free-for-all category and a winner in our themed category.  This time around we're looking for your best seasonal themed macro or close-up shots!  We'll accept anything with a holiday or winter theme.  The challenge will run from now until January 1st.  Our 2 winners will be the first the receive our brand new Close-Up Project T-shirts!  The shirt designs are still in the works but we'll be announcing more about them in the near future.
<p id="aeaoofnhgocdbnbeljkmbjdmhbcokfdb-mousedown">As usual, In order for you photos to be considered follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Take some macro or close-up shots of anything you want!</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Use any post-processing techniques you wish to perfect your image</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Join and  upload your macro or close-up photographs to our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thecloseupproject/" target="_blank">Flickr group</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Submit your entry by January 1, 2014</strong></li>
</ol>
Upload as many images as you’d like.  The only rules are that the image must be considered macro or close-up.  In early January we’ll select a winner from both categories who will receive a free t-shirt as  well as having their work featured in an upcoming post on site.  Good Luck!
