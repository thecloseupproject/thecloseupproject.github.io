For our 5th photo challenge we're asking you to go out and get some macro or close-up shots of winter weather. If you happen to live somewhere that doesn't have the typical winter weather simply submit some weather related shots! Use your imagination and have fun (and don't forget your camera's protective gear). Please submit your photos before April 1st. The winner will receive a free t-shirt from our <a href="http://cafepress.com/thecloseupproject" target="_blank">store</a>.
