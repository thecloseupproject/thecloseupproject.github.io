You set out to make an image.  What is your exposure going to be?  It is choice based in physics with creative and artistic implications.  How do you calculate what the exposure needs to be?  Use use a light meter.

In exposure 1 we discussed the the different parts that make up exposure.  For a quick review the 3 parts are apature, shutter speed and ISO.  The combinations of these 3 determine your exposure.  Since they are work by doubling and having the amount of light there are many ways to combine the different elements to create the exposure you need.

When it comes to light meters there are different types that read light in different ways.  The type type built into your camera is a reflective light meter.  It works by reading the amount of light being reflected and then calculates to make it 18% grey.
