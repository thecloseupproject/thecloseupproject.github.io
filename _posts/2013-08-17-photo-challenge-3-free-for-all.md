Congratulations, once again, to <a href="http://Flickr.com/edwardconde" target="_blank">Edward Conde</a> who is the default winner of our 2nd photo challenge - "Patterns". Edward was the only one to submit photos to the Flickr site during the entry timeframe. You can view his entries on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thecloseupproject/">The Close-Up Project Flickr Page.</a>

In hopes of getting some more engagement this time around we're opening up the contest to any and all macro or close-up photographs!  As usual, winners will have their shots featured in an upcoming post on TheCloseupProject.com. 

<p>In order for you photos to be considered follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Take some macro or close-up shots of anything you want!</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Use any post-processing techniques you wish to perfect your image</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Join and  upload your macro or close-up photographs to our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thecloseupproject/" target="_blank">Flickr group</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Submit your entry by October 31, 2013</strong></li>
</ol>
Upload as many images as you'd like.  The only rules are that the image must be considered macro or close-up.  In early November we'll select 3 photographs to feature on The Close-Up Project.
