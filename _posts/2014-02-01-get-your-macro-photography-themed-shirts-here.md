We here at The Close-Up Project are happy to announce that you can now get your very own CUP swag!  We've opened a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/thecloseupproject">shop over at CafePress.com</a>.  Right now we're offering just a single design that highlights one of the fundamental principals of macro photography: the ratio of the size of the subject and the size of the image on your camera's sensor.  We've got plans for some new designs so be sure to check back often!
