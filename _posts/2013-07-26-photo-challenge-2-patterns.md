Thanks again to everyone who submitted photographs during our <a title="Photo Challenge Winners – Spring Flowers" href="http://thecloseupproject.com/photo-challenge-winners-spring-flowers/" target="_blank">first photo challenge</a> - spring flowers!  We were really impressed with all of the entires and selecting a winner was very difficult.  Today we're announcing the theme for our next photo challenge: <strong>patterns</strong>.  One of the most intriguing thing about macro photography is finding those hidden patterns in objects that we don't notice in our day-to-day lives.  We're challenging you this time around to find those un-discovered patterns.  As with our last contest, the winners will be featured in an upcoming post on the site.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Take some macro or close-up shots that incorporate some sort of pattern</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Use any post-processing techniques you wish to perfect your image</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Join and  upload your macro or close-up photographs of patterns to our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/thecloseupproject/" target="_blank">Flickr group</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Tag the photo "patterns"</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Submit your entry by July 31, 2013</strong></li>
</ol>
Upload as many images as you'd like.  The only rules are that the image must be considered macro or close-up.  In early August we'll select 3 photographs to feature on The Close-Up Project.
